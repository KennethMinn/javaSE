##Thread life cycle
#Primitive - not modern

New (start) -> Runnable (ready) -> Running (read IO) -> Dead

//go back to runnable state when the thread is notify/notifyAll(), resume() or when sleep time is up

New (start) -> Runnable (ready) <- Running (blocked/waiting or sleeping)

synchronize limitation -> one thread at a time

#Semaphore

value = 1

lock(

)
value--

another lock (
 if value is 0 -> block
)

#SEMAPHORE EXAMPLE

toilet = [ 3 rooms]
acquire() -> pass
2 rooms left
acquire() -> pass
1 room left
acquire() -> pass
0 room left
acquire() -> block -> wait

acquire() -> value++
1 room
