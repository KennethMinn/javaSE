single programming
multi programming -> concurrent, parallel

1 -> 2 -> 3 = concurrent (1 core)
1 & 2 & 3 = parallel (multi core)

- process -> a programming that is running on memory
- thread -> things that are inside of process (1 process maybe contains 4 or 5 or 8 threads)
- threads are independent

concurrent

- scheduling (running a process after a process)
- interleave , switching (cpu usage for a process after a process (stopping a idle process to run a another process))

parallel

- process -> threads
